# Key Questions and Long-Form Answers in SQL

## 1. What is SQL and what are its main components?
**Answer:**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Its main components are:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define and modify database structures.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Used for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Used to control access to data.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Used to manage transactions in the database.

Example in SQL:
```sql
-- DDL Example
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    BirthDate DATE,
    Position VARCHAR(50)
);

-- DML Example
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, Position)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '1980-01-15', 'Manager');

SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- DCL Example
GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO User1;

-- TCL Example
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Employees SET Position = 'Senior Manager' WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
COMMIT;
```

## 2. How do you retrieve data from a single table?
**Answer:**
Retrieving data from a single table is done using the `SELECT` statement.

Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Position
FROM Employees
WHERE Position = 'Manager';
```

This query selects the first name, last name, and position of employees who hold the position of 'Manager'.

## 3. How do you retrieve data from multiple tables using JOIN?
**Answer:**
To retrieve data from multiple tables, SQL provides various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN).

Example:
```sql
-- Assuming we have another table Departments
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'Finance');

-- Add a foreign key to Employees table
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD DepartmentID INT;

-- Example of INNER JOIN
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
```

## 4. How do you filter data using the WHERE clause?
**Answer:**
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE BirthDate > '1980-01-01' AND Position = 'Manager';
```

This query selects all employees born after January 1, 1980, who are managers.

## 5. How do you sort data using the ORDER BY clause?
**Answer:**
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns.

Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, BirthDate
FROM Employees
ORDER BY BirthDate DESC;
```

This query selects the first name, last name, and birth date of all employees, sorted by birth date in descending order.

## 6. How do you group data using the GROUP BY clause and aggregate functions?
**Answer:**
The `GROUP BY` clause is used with aggregate functions to group the result set by one or more columns.

Example:
```sql
SELECT Position, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Position
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This query counts the number of employees in each position, but only includes positions with more than one employee.

## 7. How do you use subqueries in SQL?
**Answer:**
Subqueries are nested queries used within another SQL query.

Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'HR');
```

This query selects the first name and last name of employees who work in the 'HR' department.

## 8. How do you use window functions for advanced analytics?
**Answer:**
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.

Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Position, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY BirthDate) AS RankByBirthDate
FROM Employees;
```

This query ranks employees by their birth date.

## 9. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
**Answer:**
SQL provides functions to handle NULL values, such as `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, and `COALESCE`.

Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, COALESCE(Position, 'Not Assigned') AS Position
FROM Employees;
```

This query selects the first name, last name, and position, substituting 'Not Assigned' for any NULL position values.

## 10. How do you manage database transactions?
**Answer:**
Transactions ensure that a series of SQL operations are executed as a single unit. They use `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.

Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Employees SET Position = 'Manager' WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate, Position) VALUES (3, 'Jane', 'Smith', '1990-05-20', 'Analyst');

IF @@ERROR > 0
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    COMMIT;
END;
```
